            <article>
                <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Speculative Frenzy Builds Around Trump-Backed DeFi Project</h4>
                <p class="article" style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                    The derivatives market for World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the Trump family–backed decentralized finance token, saw explosive growth ahead of its highly anticipated unlock event on September 1, 2025. Trading volume and open interest soared as investors braced for the release of nearly $483 million worth of tokens.

                <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Derivatives Activity Reaches Record Levels</h4>
                <ul style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                    <li>
                        WLFI derivatives trading spiked between 400% and 563% in the 24 hours leading up to the unlock.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Open interest surged 50–60%, with levels reported between $760 million and $950 million across major exchanges.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Binance dominated the frenzy, accounting for more than $2 billion of WLFI futures and options activity.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                    The scale of this derivatives boom positioned WLFI as one of the most actively traded DeFi tokens of 2025.

                <h4>Token Unlock Details</h4>
                <p>
                    The September 1 unlock released 20% of presale tokens, representing roughly 5% of total supply and valued at $483 million.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Early investors, who bought in at $0.015, saw theoretical gains of up to 20×, with pre-market WLFI trading near $0.32.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A “Lockbox” mechanism governs unlocks, with remaining presale tokens (80%) to be released in phases subject to governance votes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Trump family’s estimated 22.5 billion WLFI holdings remain locked pending future community decisions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>Valuation Speculation</h4>
                <p>
                Pre-unlock trading implied a fully diluted valuation of $31–40 billion, placing WLFI in the same league as major cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and TRON.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, after the unlock, estimates of WLFI’s market cap varied sharply — some reports suggested an initial surge past $30 billion, later stabilizing closer to $4–5 billion.
                </p>

            <article>
                <h4>Supply & Price Management</h4>
                <p>To ease volatility:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    WLFI introduced a buyback-and-burn program, removing roughly 47 million tokens (≈0.2% of circulating supply).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Security audits by Cyfrin verified the Lockbox system, adding transparency and reducing fears of contract risk.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Despite these measures, WLFI remains prone to daily price swings of 4–8%, spiking as high as 20% during major events.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>Outlook</h4>
                <p>
                    The WLFI unlock has cemented the token as one of the most watched projects in the DeFi space. While derivatives activity reflects strong speculative demand, the token’s long-term trajectory will hinge on governance decisions, unlock schedules, and investor confidence in its burn mechanisms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For traders, WLFI offers both opportunity and risk: massive potential gains on one hand, and sharp volatility on the other.
